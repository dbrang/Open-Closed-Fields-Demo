# Open-Closed-Fields-Demo
An interactive, browser-based simulation designed to build an intuitive understanding of the biophysical origins of EEG signals. This tool visualizes how neuronal geometry and population alignment determine whether electrical fields summate to form a detectable signal at the scalp ("Open Field") or cancel out ("Closed Field").
